		<h5>Collectables: An easy way to add more depth and character to your player models.</h5>

		<h5>You've done a lot of worldbuilding so far in creating your game. You have customized your own universe, built a landscape to fit your character, but there's no objective in our game yet.</h5>
		<p>Keep your notes handy that you made earlier. Just like with our terrain and how we built the scene that our main character will be immersed in. But just like how actors need props, our player needs to have an objective. We will accomplish this by adding items into our world which will make our universe richer with details and the overal arching storyline.</p>
		<p>We're going to focus on adding an object to collect as our object, or quest. We're going to create a model that gives the player points over time. First let's go shopping in the <strong>Asset Store</strong></p>

		<h6>Just like we searched for trees, skyboxes, and players, we need to have items in our world to make the story richer.</h6>

		<p>Simple items like a book, a weapon, or simply a block are good collectables. They tell the player that they need said item for an upcoming event, and can inspire excitement especially if the item is really rare.</p>

		  <br>
		  <p>Right now, your collectable will have a transform component, likely along with a <strong>Mesh Filter</strong> and <strong>Mesh Renderer</strong>. Those components will help Unity put the model into the 3D space.</p>
		  <p>We're going to add a new component to the collectable: a collider. Also known as a hitbox, this component detects when an object touches another object. In the <strong>Inspector</strong> for the collectable, click <strong>Add Component at the bottom</strong></p>

		  <p>You'll see a green box around your object now, this is your collider</p>
		  <img src="./unity_images/collectables3.jpg" width="200px">
		  <p>In the collider's settings (in the Inspector), we're going to click the box that says <strong>Is Trigger</strong>.</p>
		  <p>When testing, the cursor will be locked. To unlock it so you can stop or pause the game, press <strong>Escape</strong></p>
		  <p>There are two types of colliders in Unity - normal colliders and trigger colliders. <strong>In a trigger collider, the two objects register that they touch but they don't actually collide (they can go through each other without slowing down)</strong>.

		  <p>In Mario games, for example, if you slowed down every time you touched a coin it would be a real pain.</p>

			<p>We've done a lot in the Unity interface, but in order to do some things we have to use coding. The language we're using is called <strong>C#</strong> (pronounced “c sharp”). It's based on C just like C++ is, if you've heard of that. We're going to write scripts that are attached as <strong>components</strong> to our objects!</p>
			<p>The characters that we dragged in from the Standard Assets already have some scripts on them. We've been editing the variables in those scripts to do things like change the characters' speeds. You can see these scripts in the Inspector.</p>
			<p>But to actually write a script, we need to use a text editor. We're going to create our first script using a text editor called Atom or Visual Studio! (You may need to create a Microsoft account to use Visual Studio) Go to the collectable and click the <strong>Add Component</strong> button in the <strong>Inspector</strong>. Click <strong>New Script</strong> and name it <strong>CollectableScript</strong>. <strong>Make sure the language is set to C#</strong>.</p>

			<p>This is a default C# script in Unity. For now, we can <strong>ignore the first few lines</strong>. These are called <strong>namespaces</strong> and we will use them in a bit. The code we'll be typing begins on <strong>line 5</strong>. Every time we make a script in Unity, it makes a <strong>class</strong> with that script name.

			<br>
			<p>Here are the two default functions:</p>
			<p><strong>Start function</strong> - code between the brackets will run <strong>once at the start</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Update function</strong> - code between the brackets will run <strong>once every frame</strong>. Games usually run at 30 or more frames per second, so this code is basically always running!</p>

			<p>Let's write our first function! <i> We're going to use another built-in function called <strong>OnTriggerEnter</strong>.</i></p>
			<p>This function is called when an object enters the trigger collider we just put on!</p>
			<p>Write <strong>void OnTriggerEnter()</strong>
			<p><strong>OnTriggerEnter</strong> must be capitalized in camel case (this means no spaces and every word capitalized!)! Then put opening and closing curly brackets:</p>
			<p><i>void OnTriggerEnter(){</i></p>
			<p><i>}</i></p>
			<br>
			<p>As a return type, <strong>void</strong> means it returns nothing.</p>
			<p>This function does needs a parameter to run. <i>This parameter, called a collider, refers to the object that our collectable bumps into.</i> We're going to feed that to the function and give it a name.</p>
			<img src="./unity_images/collectables13.jpg" width="500px">
			<p>Great! The function is all set up. There's no code in it though! So what do we want to happen when the player hits the collectable? The collectable should disappear (and the player should gain some benefit; we'll get to that later). We need to add code that makes the collectable disappear! Here's how most lines of code work in C#:</p>
			<img src="./unity_images/collectables14.jpg" width="500px">
			<p>To make the object disappear, we need to use a function called <strong>SetActive()</strong>. This function takes a parameter (whether to turn the object on or off). This function is within the class <strong>gameObject</strong>, which is a set of functions that allow us to target the <stong>GameObject</strong> the script is on. Go ahead and add this line to your <strong>OnTriggerEnter</strong> function. It uses this function to set the <strong>GameObject</strong> (the collectable) to inactive (because of the false). <i>All lines that are not function names or logic end in a semicolon!</i></p>
			<br>
			<p>Great work on your first line of code! We're not quite done yet, though. Think about how this function works:</p>
			<p><i>When does it get called?</i> When the collectable touches something.</p>
			<p><i>What does it do then?</i> It makes the collectable disappear.</p>
			<br>
			<p>What's the problem with this logic? <strong>The object will disappear if it touches literally anything</strong>. If it touches the floor, or an enemy, or anything else with a collider, it'll disappear! <strong>We only want to disappear if the collectable is touching the player</strong>. How can we check this?</p>
