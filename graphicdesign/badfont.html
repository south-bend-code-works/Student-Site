      <h4 class="projectTitle">What makes a bad font, bad?</h4>
        <p>You've been using a lot of different typefaces in your designs, and we have been telling you what's good, what's bad along the way. Though, how are you able to tell a good font from a bad one?</p>
        <p>One word: <strong>legiblity</strong></p>
        <p>Part of what makes a strong font is it's readability. There are other factors, like how fresh or new the font seems, or if it's been overused.</p>
        <p>If it's easier to read, people will straight up want to.</p>

        <h4>But how do you pick a winning font?</h4>
        <h5>Think about a few simple things...</h5>
        <p><strong>Overused:</strong> When a typeface is overused, it gets tired. Massive miss-use or over-use makes it ordinary and annoying.</p>
        <p><strong>Kerning:</strong> That space between letters can add up. While you can fix the kerning manually, it is time consuming and is a hallmark of a bad typeface.</p>
        <p><strong>Legibility:</strong> If it's illegible, people have to make a huge effort to read what you're trying to say. It's easy to lose interest along the way, even if it's fancy. Cursive is a great example. </p>

        <h4>Ready to test your knowledge?</h4>
        <h5>Test your kerning skills: <a href="https://type.method.ac/">type.method.ac/</a></h5>
        <p>Remember, kerning is the space inbetween the letters. As an advanced graphic designer you will be working with typefaces and adjusting them pixel by pixel. Sometimes you find the perfect font, but the space between the letters is too big or small. This will give you a taste of the small adjustments and big ramifications that kerning can make.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Know your typefaces? <a href="https://shape.method.ac/">shape.method.ac/</a></h5>
        <p>This game is a challenge! Part of typography design is refining the shapes of typefaces. Some Graphic Designers specialize in typefaces, making unique typefaces for companies, for themselves, or simply for any one to use. This is your chance to try your hand at typeface design.</p>
        <p>Move the purple dot gradually to even out the shape of the letter, this is a tricky one because you need look at the overall theme of the typeface, some are curvy, some are geometric. When you think youâ€™ve got it, hit compare and see how correct you were!</p>
